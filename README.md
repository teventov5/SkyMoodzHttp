Final version of SkyMoodz weather desktop App.   Created by T_Y.
The project was written on Java on both Sides (back and front).
Frontside is with JavaSwing (due to the lucturer request).
Backend is java with the JDBC connector to mySql. it uses an apiKey from AccuWeather to get to realtime weather data.
